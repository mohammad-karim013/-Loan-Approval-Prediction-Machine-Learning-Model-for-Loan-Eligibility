# -Loan-Approval-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Model-for-Loan-Eligibility

---

Hey there! I’m Mohammad Karim, and I’m passionate about using data to make informed decisions. In this project, I developed a Loan Approval Prediction model using Python and Machine Learning to help financial institutions quickly determine loan eligibility.

**🎯 Motivation**

Loan approval processes can be slow and prone to human bias. This project aims to:

Automate loan approval decisions using data.

Improve accuracy and reduce processing time.

Provide insights into factors influencing loan eligibility.

**💡 Business Logic Highlights**

Input Features: Applicant income, loan amount, credit history, employment type, marital status, etc.

Target Variable: Loan approval status (Approved / Not Approved).

Model: Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.

Output: Predict whether a loan should be approved.

**🚀 Project Phases**

Phase 1: Data Loading & Cleaning

import numpy as np  
import pandas as pd  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
import seaborn as sns  
from sklearn import svm  
import warnings  
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

Removed duplicates & null values.

Converted categorical variables into numerical form.

Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized distributions of applicant income, loan amount, and approval status.

Identified key factors affecting loan approval.

Phase 3: Model Training & Evaluation

Implemented an SVM classifier.

Achieved accuracy score of X% (replace with your actual result).

**🎓 Key Learnings & Best Practices**

Data preprocessing is critical for machine learning performance.

SVM works well for binary classification problems with clear margins.

EDA helps uncover trends that can improve model features.
